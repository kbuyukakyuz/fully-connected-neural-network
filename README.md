# fully-connected-neural-network lib

A neural network architecture without using any external machine learning lbrary (tensorflow, keras, pytorch, etc.)

Created generic library for a fully connected neural network. Number of neurons and number of hidden layers are arbitrary and can be changed. Implemented on Intel's dataset.

All nonlinear activations functions are included. 

Recommended to run on GPU.
